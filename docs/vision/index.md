This directory contains docs about what this project could be about.
Of course, fiction and reality may differ, but this hopefully this
directory will encapsulate the future path of this project.

The high level goal is to build a project that is able to be a foundational
component for exploring these topics.

Here is a suggested order to read the docs:
* [On an isomorphism between libraries and domain specific languages](isomorph_lang_libs.md)
* [Going beyond lambda calculus](beyond_lambda_calculus.md)
* [On the development of languages](developing_languages.md)
* [On the composition of languages](composing_languages.md)
* [A family of languages](family_of_languages.md)
